**ARACHNID** (*Automatic Real-time Aerospace deteCtion Harnessing NeuromorphIc Devices*) is a neuromorphic sensing platform composed of 8 asynchronous *Event-Based Cameras (EBCs)* arranged in a multi-view configuration inspired by arachnid vision. It leverages *Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)* for real-time, parallel detection of RSOs across multiple fields of view.

## Development Environment

All code in this repository was developed using the following stack:

- **Python** 3.10  
- **Prophesee Metavision SDK** v4.6.2  
- **BrainChip Akida** v3.11  

Development was performed on **Ubuntu 22.04**, although the code is intended to be cross-platform with minimal adjustments.

> **Note:**  
> We recommend using a dedicated environment with **conda** to manage dependencies and ensure reproducibility across systems.
